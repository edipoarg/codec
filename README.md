# Codec

Codec is a collaborative tool for managing video evidence.

## Origin and description

A response to the deluge of visual information flowing out of conflict environments and contested events, Codec is designed to support the work of researchers, journalists, legal teams, activist groups and others in adjacent fields. While the tool has many potential applications, the driving goal has been to further investigations, amplify truth, and pursue accountability for human rights abuses. The interface is a modular system split into three components: a timeline, a map, and a media player that allows users to securely synthesize large data sets of multimedia assets across the time and space of an event or series of events.


Codec originally emerged as a byproduct of attempting to solve recurring challenges in our investigative workflows—issues around collaboration, rapid visualization, and the management of video evidence. While the amount of user generated content has increased exponentially in recent years, managing the sheer volume of material can become inefficient at best and, often, simply prohibitive. Codec is designed to make this process collaborative, streamlined, efficient and intuitive. Research and development for Codec unfolded across various cases of differing scales, and through collaborating with partners, including: Amnesty International, UC Berkeley's Human Rights Center, Columbia Law School’s Human Rights Initiative, Human Rights Watch, UNITAD and many more.
